# Sudoku-271

Sudoku in C++

This project creates a Sudoku board that users can solve.  The users are timed and can choose their difficulty level, either easy, medium or hard.  They are also able to choose a mode, either Insaenz or Basic B.  Insaenz mode only alllows the user two guesses per box, while Basic B mode gives you unlimited guesses.  Hints are also available to users, but the number of total hints allowed is determined by the level the user chooses.  Upon completing the puzzle, the user is told their time and whether or not they are correct.
